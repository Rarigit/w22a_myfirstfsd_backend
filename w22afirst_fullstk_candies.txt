W22A: My First Full-Stack
Due Feb 13 by 11:59pm Points 3 Submitting a website url Available Jan 17 at 12am - Mar 18 at 11:59pm
This is it! Everything we have been working towards builds up to this workflow. Our goal is to start from nothing but an idea and end up with a fully functioning website. 

We are going to build a simple "candy posting" website. I mean it when I say simple. No signup, login, or users of any kind. We will just be dealing with candy.

This will also be practice is getting only "feature requests" from a client. There will be no specification given from me, only some features that I would want as a client.

For this part of the assignment, only worry about the local deployment of the project. We don't need to move into the cloud just yet. 

Please make sure you use 2 different Github Repositories for the Frontend and Backend code!

 

Building the project
As with all full-stack projects, you should break this down in 3 sections:
The DB
The Back-End
The Front-End
The feature set is simple:
Clients can create candy posts
Clients can delete candy posts
Clients can edit candy posts
Clients can read candy posts
Please submit both GitHub links for grading

HINTS:

Don't overcomplicate the DB. This is a simple application with only "candy" meaning you probably only need one table
There is no "ownership" of candy like in Foodie.
You probably don't need more than one page on the front-end
 

BONUS:

 Add a simple sign-up and login feature (this sounds simple, but will requires a change at almost every level)
Your users only need a username and password
Add ownership to candy i.e. the creator of the candy is the only one able to delete and edit that candy. Everyone can still read all the candy.
